About
=====
This is a TextMate/Sublime/VS Code/Atom bundle providing language support for x86_64 assembly language in a variety of dialects (nasm/yasm primarily, but could highlight tasm/gas to some extent).

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
